The project's main goal is to bring the users closer together. The people today are growing close to each other through social media but losing connections in the physical world. The most impacted people due to this are the families. Even though people in a family live together, they are quite distant from each other. This has been the case for quite some time and now with the COVID-19 pandemic underway; people are forced to be in self quarantine. Thus, causing all the members of the family to stay under the roof all the time. We, the *CP317T03* team has taken the initiative to develop an application that can help families and friends, fill up these gaps and brings them closer through the power of technology.
